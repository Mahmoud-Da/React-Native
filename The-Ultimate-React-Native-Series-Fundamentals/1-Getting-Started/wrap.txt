*** 3- What is React Native ***
# Lecture Notes: What Is React Native and Is It Right for You?

## Definition of React Native

* **React Native** is a framework for building **native mobile applications** for:

  * iOS
  * Android
* Applications are built using **JavaScript**.

## Key Idea

* If you know JavaScript, you can use it to build **real native mobile apps**.
* React Native apps are:

  * Truly native
  * Not web apps wrapped to look like mobile apps

## Native vs Web Apps

* React Native does **not** render HTML or run inside a browser.
* It uses native UI components provided by:

  * iOS
  * Android
* The result is performance and user experience comparable to fully native apps.

## Need for Native Platform Knowledge

* You generally **do not need** to know:

  * iOS development (Swift / Objective-C)
  * Android development (Java / Kotlin)
* Native knowledge is only required when:

  * Building very complex features
  * Accessing platform-specific native APIs directly
* For most applications:

  * Almost all code is written in JavaScript
  * Code is shared across iOS and Android

## Business and Industry Benefits

* Single shared codebase for both platforms
* Reduced development and maintenance cost
* No need to maintain:

  * Separate iOS team
  * Separate Android team
* This is why many companies prefer React Native for mobile development

## Common Misconception

* Misconception: React Native cannot be used for serious or large-scale applications
* Reality: Many high-profile production apps are built using React Native

## Real-World Examples

Apps built with React Native include:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Pinterest
* Skype
* Uber Eats
* Many other large-scale applications

## When React Native Is the Right Choice

* You want to turn a real app idea into production
* You already have JavaScript skills
* You want to build for both iOS and Android efficiently
* You want near-native performance with a shared codebase

## Conclusion

* React Native is a powerful and production-proven framework
* It enables JavaScript developers to build serious, high-quality mobile applications
* It is one of the best tools to add to your JavaScript and mobile development toolbox


*** 4- Expo ***

# Lecture Notes: Ways to Build React Native Apps

## Overview

There are **two main approaches** to building React Native applications:

1. Plain React Native (React Native CLI)
2. Expo

## Option 1: Expo

### What Is Expo?

* Expo is a **framework and set of tools** built on top of React Native.
* It hides much of the underlying complexity of mobile development.

### Advantages of Expo

* Very fast and easy setup
* Ideal for beginners with no mobile development experience
* You can build and run your first app within minutes
* Provides many built-in native features out of the box

### Project Structure with Expo

* Only JavaScript code is visible
* No separate:

  * Android project
  * iOS project
* You cannot directly access native platform APIs
* You are limited to the native features that Expo provides

### Is This a Limitation?

* For most applications, this is **not a problem**
* Expo includes a wide range of native capabilities
* You can build a fully functional, production-ready app using Expo alone

### Ejecting from Expo

* If you need more flexibility:

  * Custom native components
  * Direct access to iOS or Android APIs
* You can **eject** from Expo
* Ejecting generates the underlying Android and iOS projects
* This process will be covered later in the course

## Option 2: React Native CLI

### What Is React Native CLI?

* The standard command-line interface for React Native
* Creates a project that includes native platform code

### Project Structure with React Native CLI

* Separate folders for:

  * Android (native Android project)
  * iOS (native iOS project)
* JavaScript code shared across both platforms

### Who Is This For?

* Developers with:

  * iOS development experience
  * Android development experience
* Those who need full control over native APIs and components

## Course Decision

* The course assumes **no prior mobile development experience**
* Expo will be used throughout the course
* Focus is on building a complete, real-world app using Expo

## What’s Next

* The next lecture will cover:

  * Setting up the React Native development environment


*** 5- Setting Up the Development Environment ***
---

# Lecture Notes: Development Environment Setup (Expo + React Native)

## 1. Node.js Requirement

### Required Version

* Node.js **version 12 or higher** is required.

### Check Node Version

* Run the following command in the terminal:

  -------------------code----------------------
  node -v
  -------------------code----------------------
* Example shown: `v12.14.1`
* If your version is lower than 12, you must upgrade Node.js before continuing.

## 2. Installing Expo CLI

### What Is Expo CLI?

* A command-line tool that allows you to:

  * Create React Native projects
  * Run and manage Expo-based applications easily

### Installation Command

* Install Expo CLI globally using npm:

  -------------------code----------------------
  npm install -g expo-cli
  -------------------code----------------------

### macOS Permission Note

* If npm permissions are not configured properly on macOS, prefix the command with:

  -------------------code----------------------
  sudo npm install -g expo-cli
  -------------------code----------------------

### Installation Notes

* Installation may take some time
* You may see warnings during installation

  * These warnings can be safely ignored

## 3. Expo Client App (Physical Device Testing)

### What Is Expo Client?

* A mobile app that lets you run your React Native app on a real device

### Installation

* Download **Expo Go (Expo Client)** from:

  * Apple App Store (iOS)
  * Google Play Store (Android)

### Purpose

* Enables easy testing on a physical phone without:

  * Android Studio
  * Xcode
  * Simulators

## 4. Code Editor: Visual Studio Code

### Recommended Editor

* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

### Why VS Code?

* Free and lightweight
* Excellent React Native support
* Instructor will demonstrate:

  * Shortcuts
  * Productivity tips
  * Debugging techniques
* Using the same editor makes it easier to follow along

### Download

## 5. VS Code Extensions

These extensions are optional but strongly recommended.

### 1. React Native Tools

* Built by Microsoft
* Enables debugging React Native apps directly in VS Code
* Widely used and well-supported

### 2. React Native / React / Redux Snippets

* Provides code snippets for:

  * React
  * React Native
  * Redux
* Allows fast code generation using shortcuts
* Helps speed up development significantly

### 3. Prettier – Code Formatter

* Automatically formats code
* Maintains consistent style across the project
* Very popular and commonly used in JavaScript projects

### 4. Material Icon Theme

* Adds file-type icons to the project explorer
* Improves readability and navigation
* Different file types get different icons

## 6. VS Code Settings: Format on Save

### Enable Automatic Formatting

* Open:

  * Preferences → Settings
* Search for:

  * `format on save`
* Enable **Format on Save**

### Result

* Every time you save a file:

  * Prettier automatically formats the code
* Works with:

  * `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux)
  * `Cmd + S` (macOS)

## 7. Key Takeaways

* Correct Node.js version is essential
* Expo CLI simplifies React Native development
* Expo Client allows fast testing on real devices
* VS Code + extensions improve productivity and code quality
* Automatic formatting helps maintain clean, readable code

## What’s Next

* The next step will involve:

  * Creating and running the first Expo-based React Native project


*** 6- Your First App ***
---

# Lecture Notes: Creating and Running the First Expo Project

## 1. Creating a New Expo Project

### Initializing the Project

* In the terminal, run:

  -------------------code----------------------
  expo init done-with-it
  -------------------code----------------------

  or if we want to use npm as package manger
  -------------------code----------------------
  expo init done-with-it --npm
  -------------------code----------------------
* `done-with-it` is the app name used in the course.
* You can choose a different name if you prefer.

## 2. Choosing a Workflow

### Managed vs Bare Workflow

#### Managed Workflow

* Expo handles most of the underlying complexity.
* No visible:

  * iOS project
  * Android project
* Only JavaScript code is exposed.
* Ideal for beginners.

#### Bare Workflow

* Creates a bare-bones React Native project.
* Includes:

  * iOS project
  * Android project
* Suitable for developers with native mobile experience.

### Course Choice

* The course uses:

  * **Blank managed workflow**
* A TypeScript template is available but not used:

  * To avoid extra complexity early in the course.

## 3. Opening the Project

* Once project creation is complete:

  * Navigate into the project folder.
  * Open it in Visual Studio Code.

## 4. Project Structure Overview

### Assets Folder

* Used for static resources such as:

  * Images
  * Audio files
  * Videos
* Any asset bundled with the app goes here.

### `App.js`

* The main entry point of the application.
* Contains a basic React Native component.

## 5. Understanding `App.js`

### Imports

* Imports React.
* Imports core components from React Native.

### Core Components

* **View**

  * Similar to a `div` in web development.
* **Text**

  * Used to display text on the screen.

### No HTML in React Native

* React Native does not use:

  * `div`, `p`, `a`, etc.
* Instead, it provides platform-agnostic components.

### Function Components

* React Native uses **function components by default**.
* Advantages:

  * Simpler
  * More lightweight
* Class components are supported but discouraged.

### JSX Structure

* The component returns JSX:

  * A `View` as the container
  * A `Text` component inside it

## 6. Styling in React Native

### StyleSheet

* Styles are defined using `StyleSheet.create`.
* Styles are plain JavaScript objects.

### Example

* `styles.container` references a style object.
* Property names resemble CSS:

  * `backgroundColor`, etc.
* These are not CSS rules, but JavaScript properties.

### How Styling Works Internally

* During compilation:

  * React Native maps components and styles to native widgets.
* Examples:

  * `View` → `UIView` on iOS
  * `View` → Android `View` on Android
* This abstraction allows:

  * Platform-independent UI code
  * Truly native apps

## 7. Starting the Expo Development Server

### Opening the Terminal in VS Code

* Use:

  * View → Terminal
* Shortcut on macOS:

  * `Ctrl + ` (backtick)

### Starting the Server

* Run:

  -------------------code----------------------
  npm start
  -------------------code----------------------

* This starts the Expo development server.

* result:
-------------------code----------------------
> done-with-it@1.0.0 start
> expo start
