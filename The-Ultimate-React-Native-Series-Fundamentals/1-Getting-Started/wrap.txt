# Lecture Overview: Ultimate React Native Course – Introduction

## Instructor

* **Instructor:** Mosh
* **Course Goal:** Teach React Native from scratch with a deep understanding of concepts and code.

## Target Audience

* Beginners with **no prior React Native knowledge**
* Learners who want to understand:

  * Every line of code
  * Core principles behind React Native development

## Course Approach

* No simple or dummy applications (e.g., to-do apps or calculators)
* Focus on building a **real, production-like mobile application**
* Emphasis on:

  * Performance
  * Clean UI/UX
  * Real-world features

## Main Project: “Done With It” App

A full-featured marketplace app for selling items you no longer need.

### App Concept

* A marketplace for listing and selling second-hand items
* Users can browse, post, and manage listings

## Core Features Demonstrated

### Authentication

* Login and registration screens
* User accounts with personalized data

### Listings

* Display a list of items for sale
* Example: Red jacket listed for $100
* Data shown is dummy/generated for learning purposes

### Item Details

* Tap an item to view:

  * Item description
  * Seller information
  * Item location displayed on a map

### Messaging & Notifications

* Users can send messages to sellers
* Messages trigger **push notifications** on the recipient’s device

### Gestures & Interactions

* Pull down to close item details
* Pull to refresh the listings
* Swipe left to delete an item

### Filtering

* Filter listings by category (e.g., cameras)

### Creating a New Listing

Steps involved:

1. Select images (up to 3 images)
2. Enter a title
3. Set a price (e.g., $99)
4. Choose a category (e.g., furniture)
5. Post the listing to the server

### Upload Experience

* Progress bar displayed during upload
* Smooth animation upon completion

### User Account Page

* View personal listings
* Access received messages
* Manage posted items

## Learning Outcome

By the end of the course, students will:

* Master React Native fundamentals
* Build real-world mobile applications
* Understand UI interactions commonly found in modern apps
* Develop confidence in mobile app development

## Conclusion

* The course provides a complete, practical learning experience
* Focused on real app behavior and professional development standards
* Sets the foundation for building high-quality mobile apps with React Native

# Lecture Notes: Course Prerequisites and Background Knowledge

## React Native and Prior Knowledge

* No prior experience with:

  * React Native
  * Mobile app development
    is required to take this course.

## Required Knowledge

### JavaScript

* Solid understanding of JavaScript is required.
* Learners should be comfortable with:

  * Variables and functions
  * Modern JavaScript syntax

### React

* Basic to intermediate knowledge of React is required because:

  * React Native is built on top of React.
  * Instead of targeting the browser (DOM), React Native targets **mobile platforms**.

## React Concepts You Should Know

You do not need to be a React expert, but you should understand the core concepts:

* Components
* JSX
* Props
* State
* Fundamental React application structure

## Learning Resources for React

If you need to strengthen your React knowledge:

* A **2-hour React tutorial** is available on the instructor’s YouTube channel.
* A **13-hour comprehensive React course** is also available, covering:

  * Basics
  * Intermediate topics
  * Advanced React concepts

## Summary

* Beginners to mobile development are welcome.
* JavaScript and React fundamentals are mandatory.
* Additional learning resources are provided for students who need a React refresher before continuing with the course.


*** 3- What is React Native ***
# Lecture Notes: What Is React Native and Is It Right for You?

## Definition of React Native

* **React Native** is a framework for building **native mobile applications** for:

  * iOS
  * Android
* Applications are built using **JavaScript**.

## Key Idea

* If you know JavaScript, you can use it to build **real native mobile apps**.
* React Native apps are:

  * Truly native
  * Not web apps wrapped to look like mobile apps

## Native vs Web Apps

* React Native does **not** render HTML or run inside a browser.
* It uses native UI components provided by:

  * iOS
  * Android
* The result is performance and user experience comparable to fully native apps.

## Need for Native Platform Knowledge

* You generally **do not need** to know:

  * iOS development (Swift / Objective-C)
  * Android development (Java / Kotlin)
* Native knowledge is only required when:

  * Building very complex features
  * Accessing platform-specific native APIs directly
* For most applications:

  * Almost all code is written in JavaScript
  * Code is shared across iOS and Android

## Business and Industry Benefits

* Single shared codebase for both platforms
* Reduced development and maintenance cost
* No need to maintain:

  * Separate iOS team
  * Separate Android team
* This is why many companies prefer React Native for mobile development

## Common Misconception

* Misconception: React Native cannot be used for serious or large-scale applications
* Reality: Many high-profile production apps are built using React Native

## Real-World Examples

Apps built with React Native include:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Pinterest
* Skype
* Uber Eats
* Many other large-scale applications

## When React Native Is the Right Choice

* You want to turn a real app idea into production
* You already have JavaScript skills
* You want to build for both iOS and Android efficiently
* You want near-native performance with a shared codebase

## Conclusion

* React Native is a powerful and production-proven framework
* It enables JavaScript developers to build serious, high-quality mobile applications
* It is one of the best tools to add to your JavaScript and mobile development toolbox
