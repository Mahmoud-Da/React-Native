# Lecture Notes: Course Prerequisites and Background Knowledge

## React Native and Prior Knowledge

* No prior experience with:

  * React Native
  * Mobile app development
    is required to take this course.

## Required Knowledge

### JavaScript

* Solid understanding of JavaScript is required.
* Learners should be comfortable with:

  * Variables and functions
  * Modern JavaScript syntax

### React

* Basic to intermediate knowledge of React is required because:

  * React Native is built on top of React.
  * Instead of targeting the browser (DOM), React Native targets **mobile platforms**.

## React Concepts You Should Know

You do not need to be a React expert, but you should understand the core concepts:

* Components
* JSX
* Props
* State
* Fundamental React application structure

## Learning Resources for React

If you need to strengthen your React knowledge:

* A **2-hour React tutorial** is available on the instructor’s YouTube channel.
* A **13-hour comprehensive React course** is also available, covering:

  * Basics
  * Intermediate topics
  * Advanced React concepts

## Summary

* Beginners to mobile development are welcome.
* JavaScript and React fundamentals are mandatory.
* Additional learning resources are provided for students who need a React refresher before continuing with the course.


*** 3- What is React Native ***
# Lecture Notes: What Is React Native and Is It Right for You?

## Definition of React Native

* **React Native** is a framework for building **native mobile applications** for:

  * iOS
  * Android
* Applications are built using **JavaScript**.

## Key Idea

* If you know JavaScript, you can use it to build **real native mobile apps**.
* React Native apps are:

  * Truly native
  * Not web apps wrapped to look like mobile apps

## Native vs Web Apps

* React Native does **not** render HTML or run inside a browser.
* It uses native UI components provided by:

  * iOS
  * Android
* The result is performance and user experience comparable to fully native apps.

## Need for Native Platform Knowledge

* You generally **do not need** to know:

  * iOS development (Swift / Objective-C)
  * Android development (Java / Kotlin)
* Native knowledge is only required when:

  * Building very complex features
  * Accessing platform-specific native APIs directly
* For most applications:

  * Almost all code is written in JavaScript
  * Code is shared across iOS and Android

## Business and Industry Benefits

* Single shared codebase for both platforms
* Reduced development and maintenance cost
* No need to maintain:

  * Separate iOS team
  * Separate Android team
* This is why many companies prefer React Native for mobile development

## Common Misconception

* Misconception: React Native cannot be used for serious or large-scale applications
* Reality: Many high-profile production apps are built using React Native

## Real-World Examples

Apps built with React Native include:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Pinterest
* Skype
* Uber Eats
* Many other large-scale applications

## When React Native Is the Right Choice

* You want to turn a real app idea into production
* You already have JavaScript skills
* You want to build for both iOS and Android efficiently
* You want near-native performance with a shared codebase

## Conclusion

* React Native is a powerful and production-proven framework
* It enables JavaScript developers to build serious, high-quality mobile applications
* It is one of the best tools to add to your JavaScript and mobile development toolbox


*** 4- Expo ***

# Lecture Notes: Ways to Build React Native Apps

## Overview

There are **two main approaches** to building React Native applications:

1. Plain React Native (React Native CLI)
2. Expo

## Option 1: Expo

### What Is Expo?

* Expo is a **framework and set of tools** built on top of React Native.
* It hides much of the underlying complexity of mobile development.

### Advantages of Expo

* Very fast and easy setup
* Ideal for beginners with no mobile development experience
* You can build and run your first app within minutes
* Provides many built-in native features out of the box

### Project Structure with Expo

* Only JavaScript code is visible
* No separate:

  * Android project
  * iOS project
* You cannot directly access native platform APIs
* You are limited to the native features that Expo provides

### Is This a Limitation?

* For most applications, this is **not a problem**
* Expo includes a wide range of native capabilities
* You can build a fully functional, production-ready app using Expo alone

### Ejecting from Expo

* If you need more flexibility:

  * Custom native components
  * Direct access to iOS or Android APIs
* You can **eject** from Expo
* Ejecting generates the underlying Android and iOS projects
* This process will be covered later in the course

## Option 2: React Native CLI

### What Is React Native CLI?

* The standard command-line interface for React Native
* Creates a project that includes native platform code

### Project Structure with React Native CLI

* Separate folders for:

  * Android (native Android project)
  * iOS (native iOS project)
* JavaScript code shared across both platforms

### Who Is This For?

* Developers with:

  * iOS development experience
  * Android development experience
* Those who need full control over native APIs and components

## Course Decision

* The course assumes **no prior mobile development experience**
* Expo will be used throughout the course
* Focus is on building a complete, real-world app using Expo

## What’s Next

* The next lecture will cover:

  * Setting up the React Native development environment
