*** 3- What is React Native ***
# Lecture Notes: What Is React Native and Is It Right for You?

## Definition of React Native

* **React Native** is a framework for building **native mobile applications** for:

  * iOS
  * Android
* Applications are built using **JavaScript**.

## Key Idea

* If you know JavaScript, you can use it to build **real native mobile apps**.
* React Native apps are:

  * Truly native
  * Not web apps wrapped to look like mobile apps

## Native vs Web Apps

* React Native does **not** render HTML or run inside a browser.
* It uses native UI components provided by:

  * iOS
  * Android
* The result is performance and user experience comparable to fully native apps.

## Need for Native Platform Knowledge

* You generally **do not need** to know:

  * iOS development (Swift / Objective-C)
  * Android development (Java / Kotlin)
* Native knowledge is only required when:

  * Building very complex features
  * Accessing platform-specific native APIs directly
* For most applications:

  * Almost all code is written in JavaScript
  * Code is shared across iOS and Android

## Business and Industry Benefits

* Single shared codebase for both platforms
* Reduced development and maintenance cost
* No need to maintain:

  * Separate iOS team
  * Separate Android team
* This is why many companies prefer React Native for mobile development

## Common Misconception

* Misconception: React Native cannot be used for serious or large-scale applications
* Reality: Many high-profile production apps are built using React Native

## Real-World Examples

Apps built with React Native include:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Pinterest
* Skype
* Uber Eats
* Many other large-scale applications

## When React Native Is the Right Choice

* You want to turn a real app idea into production
* You already have JavaScript skills
* You want to build for both iOS and Android efficiently
* You want near-native performance with a shared codebase

## Conclusion

* React Native is a powerful and production-proven framework
* It enables JavaScript developers to build serious, high-quality mobile applications
* It is one of the best tools to add to your JavaScript and mobile development toolbox


*** 4- Expo ***

# Lecture Notes: Ways to Build React Native Apps

## Overview

There are **two main approaches** to building React Native applications:

1. Plain React Native (React Native CLI)
2. Expo

## Option 1: Expo

### What Is Expo?

* Expo is a **framework and set of tools** built on top of React Native.
* It hides much of the underlying complexity of mobile development.

### Advantages of Expo

* Very fast and easy setup
* Ideal for beginners with no mobile development experience
* You can build and run your first app within minutes
* Provides many built-in native features out of the box

### Project Structure with Expo

* Only JavaScript code is visible
* No separate:

  * Android project
  * iOS project
* You cannot directly access native platform APIs
* You are limited to the native features that Expo provides

### Is This a Limitation?

* For most applications, this is **not a problem**
* Expo includes a wide range of native capabilities
* You can build a fully functional, production-ready app using Expo alone

### Ejecting from Expo

* If you need more flexibility:

  * Custom native components
  * Direct access to iOS or Android APIs
* You can **eject** from Expo
* Ejecting generates the underlying Android and iOS projects
* This process will be covered later in the course

## Option 2: React Native CLI

### What Is React Native CLI?

* The standard command-line interface for React Native
* Creates a project that includes native platform code

### Project Structure with React Native CLI

* Separate folders for:

  * Android (native Android project)
  * iOS (native iOS project)
* JavaScript code shared across both platforms

### Who Is This For?

* Developers with:

  * iOS development experience
  * Android development experience
* Those who need full control over native APIs and components

## Course Decision

* The course assumes **no prior mobile development experience**
* Expo will be used throughout the course
* Focus is on building a complete, real-world app using Expo

## What’s Next

* The next lecture will cover:

  * Setting up the React Native development environment


*** 5- Setting Up the Development Environment ***

### 3. Prettier – Code Formatter

* Automatically formats code
* Maintains consistent style across the project
* Very popular and commonly used in JavaScript projects

### 4. Material Icon Theme

* Adds file-type icons to the project explorer
* Improves readability and navigation
* Different file types get different icons

## 6. VS Code Settings: Format on Save

### Enable Automatic Formatting

* Open:

  * Preferences → Settings
* Search for:

  * `format on save`
* Enable **Format on Save**

### Result

* Every time you save a file:

  * Prettier automatically formats the code
* Works with:

  * `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux)
  * `Cmd + S` (macOS)

## 7. Key Takeaways

* Correct Node.js version is essential
* Expo CLI simplifies React Native development
* Expo Client allows fast testing on real devices
* VS Code + extensions improve productivity and code quality
* Automatic formatting helps maintain clean, readable code

## What’s Next

* The next step will involve:

*** 6- Your First App ***
---

# Lecture Notes: Creating and Running the First Expo Project

## 1. Creating a New Expo Project

### Initializing the Project

* In the terminal, run:

  -------------------code----------------------
  expo init done-with-it
  -------------------code----------------------

  or if we want to use npm as package manger
  -------------------code----------------------
  expo init done-with-it --npm
  -------------------code----------------------
* `done-with-it` is the app name used in the course.
* You can choose a different name if you prefer.

## 2. Choosing a Workflow

### Managed vs Bare Workflow

#### Managed Workflow

* Expo handles most of the underlying complexity.
* No visible:

  * iOS project
  * Android project
* Only JavaScript code is exposed.
* Ideal for beginners.

#### Bare Workflow

* Creates a bare-bones React Native project.
* Includes:

  * iOS project
  * Android project
* Suitable for developers with native mobile experience.

### Course Choice

* The course uses:

  * **Blank managed workflow**
* A TypeScript template is available but not used:

  * To avoid extra complexity early in the course.

## 3. Opening the Project

* Once project creation is complete:

  * Navigate into the project folder.
  * Open it in Visual Studio Code.

## 4. Project Structure Overview

### Assets Folder

* Used for static resources such as:

  * Images
  * Audio files
  * Videos
* Any asset bundled with the app goes here.

### `App.js`

* The main entry point of the application.
* Contains a basic React Native component.

## 5. Understanding `App.js`

### Imports

* Imports React.
* Imports core components from React Native.

### Core Components

* **View**

  * Similar to a `div` in web development.
* **Text**

  * Used to display text on the screen.

### No HTML in React Native

* React Native does not use:

  * `div`, `p`, `a`, etc.
* Instead, it provides platform-agnostic components.

### Function Components

* React Native uses **function components by default**.
* Advantages:

  * Simpler
  * More lightweight
* Class components are supported but discouraged.

### JSX Structure

* The component returns JSX:

  * A `View` as the container
  * A `Text` component inside it

## 6. Styling in React Native

### StyleSheet

* Styles are defined using `StyleSheet.create`.
* Styles are plain JavaScript objects.

### Example

* `styles.container` references a style object.
* Property names resemble CSS:

  * `backgroundColor`, etc.
* These are not CSS rules, but JavaScript properties.

### How Styling Works Internally

* During compilation:

  * React Native maps components and styles to native widgets.
* Examples:

  * `View` → `UIView` on iOS
  * `View` → Android `View` on Android
* This abstraction allows:

  * Platform-independent UI code
  * Truly native apps

## 7. Starting the Expo Development Server

### Opening the Terminal in VS Code

* Use:

  * View → Terminal
* Shortcut on macOS:

  * `Ctrl + ` (backtick)

### Starting the Server

* Run:

  -------------------code----------------------
  npm start
  -------------------code----------------------

* This starts the Expo development server.

* result:
-------------------code----------------------
> done-with-it@1.0.0 start
> expo start

# Lecture Notes: Debugging React Native Applications (Introduction)

## 1. Debugging Overview

* Over the next lessons, multiple tools and techniques for debugging React Native apps will be introduced.
* There is no single best tool:

  * The choice depends on what you are trying to debug.
  * You can use one or combine multiple tools.

## 2. Debugging with `console.log`

### Basic Approach

* The simplest debugging method is using `console.log`.
* Example usage inside the `App` component:

  -------------------code----------------------
  console.log("App executed");
  -------------------code----------------------

### Viewing Logs

* Save the file after adding the log.
* Open the embedded terminal in VS Code.
* Log output appears in the terminal connected to Metro Bundler.

### Multiple Devices

* If multiple devices are connected:

  * Example: iOS simulator and Android emulator
* The log appears once for each connected device.
* Metro Bundler displays connected devices (e.g., iPhone and Android emulator).
* You can select a specific device in Metro Bundler to view its logs.

## 3. When to Use `console.log`

### Advantages

* Very easy to use
* Quick feedback
* No setup required

### Disadvantages

* Excessive logging can:

  * Reduce app performance
  * Clutter output
* Logging should be used only during:

  * Development

### Best Practice

* Always remove `console.log` statements before:

  * Building the app for production
  * Publishing the app

## 4. Summary

* `console.log` is the fastest way to start debugging React Native apps
* Works across all connected devices
* Must be removed before production builds

## What’s Next

* The next lesson will cover:

  * Debugging React Native applications using Chrome


*** 11- Debugging in Chrome ***
---

# Lecture Notes: Debugging React Native Apps with Chrome

## 1. Creating a Bug for Demonstration

* A bug is intentionally introduced in the `App` component:

  * A variable `x` is declared but not initialized.
  * `x.toString()` is called.
* This causes a runtime error.
export default function App() {
-------------------code----------------------
  let x;
  x.toString()
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </View>
  );
}
-------------------code----------------------

### Error Display (Red Box)

* A red error screen appears in the app.
* Error message:

  * `Undefined is not an object (evaluating x.toString)`
* The error screen shows:

  * The error message
  * The component where the error occurred (App component)

## 2. Dismissing the Error Screen

* Press `Esc` to dismiss the red error screen.

## 3. Opening the Developer Menu

Methods to open the developer menu:

* **Real device**: Shake the device
* **Android emulator**:

  * macOS: `Cmd + M`
  * Windows: `Ctrl + M`
* **iOS simulator**:

  * `Cmd + D` (may require `Ctrl + D` then `Cmd + D` on some machines)

## 4. Enabling Remote Debugging

* From the developer menu, select **Debug Remote JS**
* This causes:

  * JavaScript code to execute in Chrome instead of the device
  * A new Chrome tab opens at `localhost/debugger-ui`
* Important:

  * Remote debugging slows down the app
  * Always disable it after finishing debugging

## 5. Using Chrome Developer Tools

### Console Tab

* Shows:

  * `console.log` output
  * Runtime errors
* Example error shown:

  * `Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined`

### Sources Tab

* Used for step-by-step debugging
* Enable:

  * **Pause on exceptions**
  * **Pause on caught exceptions**
* When enabled:

  * Chrome pauses execution at the exact line where the exception occurs

## 6. Breakpoints

* You can click on any line number to add a breakpoint.
* When the app reloads:

  * Execution pauses at the breakpoint
* Allows inspection of code execution flow.

## 7. Stepping Through Code

Available controls:

* **Step over**: Execute the current line and move to the next one
* **Step into**: Enter a function call and debug it line by line
* **Step out**: Exit the current function and return to the caller

### Keyboard Shortcuts

* Using shortcuts is faster than clicking icons:

  * Windows: `F10` (step over)
  * macOS: `Cmd + '` (step over)

## 8. Inspecting Variables

* Variables can be inspected directly:

  * Hover over variables
  * Use the **Watch** panel
* Watch panel:

  * Click `+`
  * Enter variable name (e.g., `x`)
  * View its current value
* In this example:

  * `x` is `undefined`, which explains the error

## 9. Fixing the Bug

* Remove the buggy lines from the code.
* Save changes.
* Reload the app.
* The error disappears.

## 10. Cleaning Up

* Remove any breakpoints.
* Stop remote debugging:

  * Open developer menu
  * Disable **Debug Remote JS**
* Reason:

  * Remote debugging significantly slows down the app

## 11. Other Chrome DevTools Tabs

### Network Tab

* Used to inspect API requests and responses
* Will be important later when working with backend APIs

### Elements Tab

* Not useful for React Native UI inspection
* Shows debugger UI elements, not app components
* Unlike web apps, React Native elements cannot be inspected this way

## 12. Summary

* Chrome debugging allows:

  * Pausing on errors
  * Step-by-step code execution
  * Variable inspection
* Very powerful, but should only be used during development
* Always disable remote debugging after use

# Lecture Notes: Debugging React Native Apps with VS Code

## 1. Overview

* React Native apps can be debugged directly inside **VS Code**
* This provides a similar debugging experience to Chrome:

  * Breakpoints
  * Step-by-step execution
  * Variable inspection
* JavaScript code is executed remotely during debugging

## 2. Enabling Remote Debugging

* Open the **developer menu**
* Enable **Remote Debugging**
* This normally opens a Chrome debugger window
* Important:

  * Close the Chrome debugger window
  * You can debug **either in Chrome or VS Code**, not both at the same time

## 3. Installing Required VS Code Extension

* Open the **Extensions** panel in VS Code
* Search for **React Native**
* Install **React Native Tools**
* This extension provides:

  * Debug configurations
  * Integration with React Native packager

## 4. Creating `launch.json`

* Open the **Debug** panel
* VS Code suggests creating `launch.json`
* Click the link to create it
* Select **React Native** from the dropdown

### Important Notes

* Sometimes VS Code skips the dropdown and creates the file automatically
* This is normal—continue without concern

## 5. Debug Configurations

* The `launch.json` file stores debug configurations
* These configurations are added by **React Native Tools**
* Without the extension, these options will not appear

### Recommended Configuration

* **Attach to packager**
* This is the primary configuration used in the course

### Adding More Configurations

You can add configurations by:

* Clicking **Add Configuration**
* Or via **Run → Add Configuration**

Examples:

* Attach to packager
* Debug Android

## 6. Location of `launch.json`

* The file is stored in:

  * `.vscode/launch.json`

## 7. Preparing for Debugging

* Open `App.js`
* Declare a test variable:

  * Example: `let x = 1`
* Insert a breakpoint on that line

## 8. Starting the Debugger

* Open the **Debug** panel
* Select **Attach to packager**
* Click the **Play** button

## 9. Common Errors and Fixes

### Error 1: Cannot Attach to Packager

**Message:**

* Cannot attach to packager
* Are you sure it is running on port 8081?

**Cause:**

* Expo uses port **19001**
* VS Code defaults to **8081**

**Fix:**

* Go to:

  * Code → Preferences → Settings
* Search for:

  * `react-native.packager.port`
* Change the value:

  * From `8081` to `19001`

### Error 2: Another Debugger Is Already Connected

**Cause:**

* Chrome debugger window is still open

**Fix:**

* Close the Chrome debugger tab
* Only one debugger can connect at a time

## 10. Successful Debugging Session

* After fixing errors, start the debugger again
* Connection is established
* Reload the app from the developer menu
* The breakpoint is hit in `App.js`

## 11. Debugging Tools in VS Code

VS Code provides the same debugging tools as Chrome:

### Execution Controls

* Step over (shortcut: `F10`)
* Step into
* Step out
* Resume execution
* Disconnect debugger

### Variable Inspection

* Variables in scope are automatically shown
* Example:

  * `x = 1`
* Watch window:

  * Manually add variables to monitor their values

## 12. Ending the Debugging Session

Steps to cleanly exit debugging:

1. Disconnect the debugger in VS Code
2. Open developer menu in the app
3. Stop remote debugging
4. Reload the app

### Possible Warning

* Error: runtime is not ready for debugging
* Solution:

  * Reload the app
  * macOS shortcut: `Cmd + R`

## 13. Final State

* App runs normally again
* JavaScript execution returns to the device
* Debugging session is fully terminated

## 14. Summary

* VS Code debugging offers:

  * Breakpoints
  * Variable inspection
  * Step-by-step execution
* Requires:

  * React Native Tools extension
  * Correct packager port
* Always:

  * Close Chrome debugger if using VS Code
  * Stop remote debugging after finishing

*** 13- Publishing ***
---

# Lecture Notes: Publishing a React Native App with Expo

## 1. Problem with Local Development

* So far, the app is served from:

  * `localhost:19002`
* This means:

  * If the computer is turned off, the app stops working
  * If Expo CLI is stopped, the app cannot be opened in Expo Client
* The app is only accessible on the local network

## 2. What Is Expo Publishing?

* Expo allows you to **publish your app to their servers**
* After publishing:

  * The app gets a **public and permanent URL**
  * Anyone can open the app using **Expo Client**
* Similar concept to:

  * Publishing packages to NPM
* This avoids:

  * App Store submission
  * Complex build and review processes

### Important Note

* Expo publishing is:

  * For **development and testing only**
* Production apps must still go through:

  * Apple App Store
  * Google Play Store

## 3. Ways to Publish an Expo App

You can publish in two ways:

1. From **Metro Bundler UI**

   * Click **Publish or Republish Project**
2. From the terminal:

   * Run:

     -------------------code----------------------
     expo publish
     -------------------code----------------------

Both methods use the same process internally.

## 4. App Configuration (`app.json`)

* Expo reads app metadata from `app.json`
* Important fields include:

  * `name`: Display name of the app
  * `slug`: URL-friendly identifier
  * `description`: App description (optional)

### URL Structure

Published apps follow this format:

-------------------code----------------------
https://expo.io/@username/slug
-------------------code----------------------

Where:

* `username` = Expo account username
* `slug` = value from `app.json`

## 5. Publishing Process

* When publishing:

  * Expo asks for authentication
  * You can:

    * Log in to an existing Expo account
    * Create a new Expo account
* Required information:

  * Email
  * Username
  * Password

## 6. Build Step

* Expo builds:

  * JavaScript bundle
  * iOS bundle (and Android internally)
* Assets are:

  * Optimized
  * Minified
  * Compressed (enabled by default)

## 7. Published App Page

After publishing:

* Expo provides:

  * Public app URL
  * QR code
* Anyone can:

  * Scan the QR code
  * Open the app using Expo Client
* No App Store approval required

### Missing Icon

* If no app icon is set:

  * A blank placeholder appears
* This will be fixed later in the course

## 8. Updating (Republishing) the App

* You can republish the app at any time
* Example:

  * Add a description
* Steps:

  1. Click **Publish** again
  2. Enter a description
  3. Publish

## 9. Automatic Updates to `app.json`

* When publishing with a description:

  * Expo updates `app.json`
* The new description appears under:

  * `"description"` field

## 10. Result After Republishing

* App page updates automatically
* Description is visible on Expo
* Same URL is reused
* Users always get the latest published version

## 11. Key Advantages of Expo Publishing

* Extremely fast sharing
* No app store complexity
* Ideal for:

  * Testing
  * Demos
  * Client previews
  * Team collaboration

## 12. Summary

* Local Expo apps depend on your machine
* Publishing creates a permanent public link
* Publishing is simple and fast
* Perfect for development and testing
* Production deployment is covered later

*** 14- Fixing the Auto Import Issue ***

---

# Lecture Notes: Fixing Auto Import Issues in VS Code

## 1. Auto Import in VS Code

* VS Code has a built-in **auto import** feature
* It automatically adds import statements when:

  * You reference a component, function, or module
* Most of the time:

  * It works perfectly
* Sometimes:

  * It fails or behaves inconsistently

## 2. Why Auto Import Sometimes Fails

* On the instructor’s machine:

  * The issue was **not VS Code itself**
  * It was caused by **old extensions and project configuration**
* These issues were discovered **after recording the course**

## 3. Step 1: Check Installed Extensions

* Go to **Extensions** in VS Code
* Make sure you **do NOT have any extensions** related to:

  * Auto importing files
  * Automatic imports
* Reason:

  * VS Code now has native auto-import support
  * Older extensions can conflict with it
* Action:

  * Uninstall any auto-import extensions you find

## 4. Step 2: Add `jsconfig.json`

* In the **root of your project**, create a new file:

  -------------------code----------------------
  jsconfig.json
  -------------------code----------------------

### Purpose of `jsconfig.json`

* Tells VS Code:

  * “This is a **JavaScript project**”
* Without it:

  * VS Code may treat the project as **TypeScript**
  * This can break or confuse IntelliSense and auto import

### File Content

-------------------code----------------------
{
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
-------------------code----------------------

### Why Exclude `node_modules`

* Improves IntelliSense performance
* Prevents VS Code from scanning thousands of files
* Makes auto import faster and more reliable

## 5. Restart VS Code

* After:

  * Removing extensions
  * Adding `jsconfig.json`
* You **must restart VS Code**
* This ensures:

  * IntelliSense reloads correctly
  * Auto import starts working as expected

## 6. Final Notes from the Instructor

* This issue:

  * Does not happen often
  * Only appears in some setups
* It was discovered **after recording the course**
* Re-recording the affected videos wasn’t practical
* With these steps:

  * You should not face auto import problems

## 7. Summary

* Auto import failures are usually environment-related
* Fixes:

  1. Remove auto-import extensions
  2. Add `jsconfig.json`
  3. Exclude `node_modules`
  4. Restart VS Code
* After this:

  * Auto import should work smoothly

If you want, I can:

* Merge **all your React Native + Expo lectures into one structured study guide**
* Turn these notes into **exam-ready bullet summaries**
* Or **translate them** (Arabic / Japanese)
