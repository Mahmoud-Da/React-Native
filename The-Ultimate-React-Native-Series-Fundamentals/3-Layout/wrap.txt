*** 2- Dimensions ***

## Component Dimensions in React Native

### 1. Using Fixed Dimensions with `View`

In React Native, we control the size of components using **density-independent pixels (DIPs)** rather than raw pixels.

#### Example Setup

We start by importing `View` and rendering it inside a `SafeAreaView`.

-------------------code----------------------
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView, View } from "react-native";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View
        style={{
          backgroundColor: "dodgerblue",
          width: 150,
          height: 70,
        }}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
-------------------code----------------------

* `width: 150` and `height: 70` are expressed in **density-independent pixels (DIPs)**.
* DIPs allow components to appear at nearly the same physical size across different devices.

---

### 2. What Are Density-Independent Pixels (DIPs)?

* DIPs are **abstract units**, not actual pixels.
* The real pixel size depends on the device’s **scale factor**.

#### Example: iPhone 4

* Screen size: `320 × 480` points
* Scale factor: `2x`
* Actual resolution: `640 × 960` pixels

If a view has:

-------------------code----------------------
width: 150
-------------------code----------------------

Actual pixel width:

-------------------code----------------------
150 × 2 = 300 pixels
-------------------code----------------------

This is roughly half the screen width.

#### Example: iPhone 11 Pro Max

* Screen size: `414 × 896` points
* Scale factor: `3x`

Actual pixel width:

-------------------code----------------------
150 × 3 = 450 pixels
-------------------code----------------------

Again, roughly half the screen width, though it may appear slightly smaller relative to the screen.

#### Key Takeaway

You do **not** need to memorize device sizes or scale factors.

By using DIPs, React Native ensures that components look almost the same size across different devices.

---

### 3. Using Percentage-Based Dimensions

If you want a component to take **exactly half of the screen width**, you can use percentage values.

-------------------code----------------------
<View
  style={{
    backgroundColor: "dodgerblue",
    width: "50%",
    height: 70,
  }}
/>
-------------------code----------------------

Important notes:

* Percentage values must be written as **strings**.
* This guarantees proportional sizing regardless of device width.

---

### 4. Getting Screen Dimensions with the `Dimensions` API

In some cases, you may need to adjust layout based on the actual screen size.

#### Importing `Dimensions`

-------------------code----------------------
import { Dimensions } from "react-native";
-------------------code----------------------

#### Accessing Screen Size

-------------------code----------------------
const screen = Dimensions.get("screen");
console.log(screen);
-------------------code----------------------

* The argument can be:

  * `"screen"`: total screen size
  * `"window"`: visible application window

#### Difference Between `screen` and `window`

* On **iOS**: `screen` and `window` are usually the same.
* On **Android**: `window` is slightly smaller due to system UI elements.

#### Example Output

-------------------code----------------------
{
  width: 414,
  height: 896,
  scale: 3,
  fontScale: 1
}
-------------------code----------------------

* `scale: 3` means each point equals 3 physical pixels.

---

### 5. Limitation of the `Dimensions` API

The `Dimensions` API **does not automatically update** when the device orientation changes.

* If the user rotates the device, the width and height values remain the same.
* Handling orientation changes requires additional APIs, which will be covered in the next lesson.

---

## Summary

* React Native uses **density-independent pixels (DIPs)** instead of raw pixels.
* DIPs help maintain consistent component sizing across devices.
* Use **percentages** when you need exact proportional sizing.
* Use the **Dimensions API** to read screen or window size.
* `Dimensions.get()` does **not** respond to orientation changes by default.

*** 3- Detecting Orientation Changes ***

---

## Detecting Screen Orientation in React Native

### 1. Why Screen Orientation Matters

Sometimes we need to resize components based on whether the device is in **portrait** or **landscape** mode.

#### Example Scenario: Video Player

* Width: `100%`
* Height:

  * `30%` in portrait mode
  * `100%` in landscape mode

In portrait mode, the video player appears at the top.
In landscape mode, it should take the entire screen.

Using a fixed percentage alone is not enough because it does not change when the device rotates.

---

### 2. Enabling Multiple Orientations

By default, React Native apps support **portrait mode only**.

#### Update `app.json`

-------------------code----------------------
{
  "expo": {
    "orientation": "default"
  }
}
-------------------code----------------------

Available values:

* `"portrait"`: portrait only (default)
* `"landscape"`: landscape only
* `"default"`: supports both portrait and landscape

To support orientation changes, we must use `"default"`.

---

### 3. Rotating the Simulator

* iOS Simulator (Mac): `Command + Left / Right Arrow`
* Android Emulator:

  * Use the rotation buttons in the toolbar
  * Keyboard shortcuts may differ by OS

---

### 4. Why the Built-in `Dimensions` API Is Not Enough

The `Dimensions` API from `react-native`:

* Does **not** update automatically when orientation changes
* Returns static values unless manually handled

To solve this, we use **React Native Community Hooks**.

---

### 5. Installing React Native Community Hooks

In the terminal:

-------------------code----------------------
npm install @react-native-community/hooks
-------------------code----------------------

This library provides hooks that automatically respond to changes such as:

* Screen dimensions
* Device orientation

---

### 6. Using `useDimensions` Hook

#### Importing the Hook

-------------------code----------------------
import { useDimensions } from "@react-native-community/hooks";
-------------------code----------------------

#### Using It in a Component

-------------------code----------------------
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView, View } from "react-native";
import { useDimensions } from "@react-native-community/hooks";

export default function App() {
  const { width, height } = useDimensions().screen;

  console.log(width, height);

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View
        style={{
          backgroundColor: "black",
          width: "100%",
          height: "30%",
        }}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
-------------------code----------------------

Key points:

* `useDimensions()` always returns **updated values**
* Width and height change automatically when the device rotates
* This is the preferred way to read screen size when supporting multiple orientations

---

### 7. Detecting Orientation with `useDeviceOrientation`

#### Importing the Hook

-------------------code----------------------
import { useDeviceOrientation } from "@react-native-community/hooks";
-------------------code----------------------

#### Using the Hook

-------------------code----------------------
const orientation = useDeviceOrientation();
console.log(orientation);
-------------------code----------------------

Returned object:

-------------------code----------------------
{
  portrait: true,
  landscape: false
}
-------------------code----------------------

When the device rotates, the values update automatically.

---

### 8. Dynamically Resizing a Component Based on Orientation

We can now combine `useDeviceOrientation` with conditional styling.

#### Example: Responsive Video Player

-------------------code----------------------
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView, View } from "react-native";
import { useDeviceOrientation } from "@react-native-community/hooks";

export default function App() {
  const { landscape } = useDeviceOrientation();

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View
        style={{
          backgroundColor: "black",
          width: "100%",
          height: landscape ? "100%" : "30%",
        }}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
-------------------code----------------------

Behavior:

* Portrait mode → height is `30%`
* Landscape mode → height is `100%`

This makes the component fully responsive to orientation changes.

---

### 9. Safe Area Consideration

When using `SafeAreaView`:

* The component may not cover the entire screen in landscape mode
* This creates empty edges on some devices

For elements like video players, it may be better **not** to wrap them in `SafeAreaView`.

This detail is outside the scope of this lesson.

---

### 10. Final Configuration for This Course

Since the app built in this course does **not** support landscape mode:

#### Reset `app.json`

-------------------code----------------------
{
  "expo": {
    "orientation": "portrait"
  }
}
-------------------code----------------------

---

## Summary

* Orientation-aware layouts require detecting screen rotation
* `Dimensions` API does not update on rotation
* `@react-native-community/hooks` provides:

  * `useDimensions` for responsive screen size
  * `useDeviceOrientation` for orientation detection
* Orientation-based styling enables dynamic layouts
* App orientation support is controlled via `app.json`
