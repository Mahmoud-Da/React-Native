*** 1- Introduction ***
## Section Overview: Creating Layouts in React Native

This section focuses on building layouts in React Native and marks the start of implementing real application screens. You will apply these concepts directly when building the first two screens of the app.

---

## What You Will Learn

### 1. Layout Fundamentals

* How layouts work in React Native
* Differences between React Native layouts and web (CSS) layouts

### 2. Dimensions

* Working with screen width and height
* Using the `Dimensions` API
* Adapting layouts to different device sizes

### 3. Device Orientation

* Handling portrait and landscape modes
* Responding to orientation changes
* Designing responsive layouts across orientations

### 4. Flexbox in React Native

* Core flexbox concepts
* `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems`
* Building flexible and adaptive UI layouts

### 5. Positioning

* Relative positioning (default behavior)
* Absolute positioning
* When and why to use each positioning method

---

## Practical Application

* You will use all these concepts to build:

  * The first screen of the app
  * The second screen of the app
* These topics are essential for completing the exercises at the end of this section

---

## Notes

* Pay close attention to each lesson
* Take notes as these concepts are foundational
* Expect to reuse these layout techniques throughout the course

---

## Section Goal

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable creating responsive, well-structured layouts in React Native using flexbox, dimensions, orientation handling, and positioning techniques.

## Component Dimensions in React Native

### 1. Using Fixed Dimensions with `View`

In React Native, we control the size of components using **density-independent pixels (DIPs)** rather than raw pixels.

#### Example Setup

We start by importing `View` and rendering it inside a `SafeAreaView`.

-------------------code----------------------
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView, View } from "react-native";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View
        style={{
          backgroundColor: "dodgerblue",
          width: 150,
          height: 70,
        }}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
-------------------code----------------------

* `width: 150` and `height: 70` are expressed in **density-independent pixels (DIPs)**.
* DIPs allow components to appear at nearly the same physical size across different devices.

---

### 2. What Are Density-Independent Pixels (DIPs)?

* DIPs are **abstract units**, not actual pixels.
* The real pixel size depends on the device’s **scale factor**.

#### Example: iPhone 4

* Screen size: `320 × 480` points
* Scale factor: `2x`
* Actual resolution: `640 × 960` pixels

If a view has:

-------------------code----------------------
width: 150
-------------------code----------------------

Actual pixel width:

-------------------code----------------------
150 × 2 = 300 pixels
-------------------code----------------------

This is roughly half the screen width.

#### Example: iPhone 11 Pro Max

* Screen size: `414 × 896` points
* Scale factor: `3x`

Actual pixel width:

-------------------code----------------------
150 × 3 = 450 pixels
-------------------code----------------------

Again, roughly half the screen width, though it may appear slightly smaller relative to the screen.

#### Key Takeaway

You do **not** need to memorize device sizes or scale factors.

By using DIPs, React Native ensures that components look almost the same size across different devices.

---

### 3. Using Percentage-Based Dimensions

If you want a component to take **exactly half of the screen width**, you can use percentage values.

-------------------code----------------------
<View
  style={{
    backgroundColor: "dodgerblue",
    width: "50%",
    height: 70,
  }}
/>
-------------------code----------------------

Important notes:

* Percentage values must be written as **strings**.
* This guarantees proportional sizing regardless of device width.

---

### 4. Getting Screen Dimensions with the `Dimensions` API

In some cases, you may need to adjust layout based on the actual screen size.

#### Importing `Dimensions`

-------------------code----------------------
import { Dimensions } from "react-native";
-------------------code----------------------

#### Accessing Screen Size

-------------------code----------------------
const screen = Dimensions.get("screen");
console.log(screen);
-------------------code----------------------

* The argument can be:

  * `"screen"`: total screen size
  * `"window"`: visible application window

#### Difference Between `screen` and `window`

* On **iOS**: `screen` and `window` are usually the same.
* On **Android**: `window` is slightly smaller due to system UI elements.

#### Example Output

-------------------code----------------------
{
  width: 414,
  height: 896,
  scale: 3,
  fontScale: 1
}
-------------------code----------------------

* `scale: 3` means each point equals 3 physical pixels.

---

### 5. Limitation of the `Dimensions` API

The `Dimensions` API **does not automatically update** when the device orientation changes.

* If the user rotates the device, the width and height values remain the same.
* Handling orientation changes requires additional APIs, which will be covered in the next lesson.

---

## Summary

* React Native uses **density-independent pixels (DIPs)** instead of raw pixels.
* DIPs help maintain consistent component sizing across devices.
* Use **percentages** when you need exact proportional sizing.
* Use the **Dimensions API** to read screen or window size.
* `Dimensions.get()` does **not** respond to orientation changes by default.
