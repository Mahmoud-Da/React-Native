*** 1- Core Components and APIs ***
## Section Overview

This section introduces the core components and APIs in React Native that are most commonly used to build mobile applications.

---

## Purpose of Core Components and APIs

* React Native provides a set of built-in (core) components and APIs.
* These are sufficient for building most application user interfaces.
* While React Native includes many more components than covered here, the course focuses on those used most frequently.

---

## Where to Find the Full List

* Official documentation: reactnative.dev
* Navigate to the **API** section.
* The documentation includes:

  * Core UI components
  * Platform-specific components
  * Native APIs

---

## Core UI Components

* Core components are **cross-platform**.
* They work on both Android and iOS.
* During compilation, each component is mapped to its **native equivalent**.

### Example

* A `Button` component:

  * Appears as a standard Android button on Android.
  * Appears as a standard iOS button on iOS.

### Customization

* The appearance and behavior of components can be customized using **styles**.
* Styling will be covered in the next section.

---

## Platform-Specific Components

* React Native also provides components designed specifically for:

  * Android
  * iOS
* These are used when platform-specific behavior or UI is required.

---

## Core APIs

* APIs are not UI elements.
* They provide access to native functionality.
* Most core APIs are **cross-platform**.

### Examples

* `Keyboard`: control and interact with the soft keyboard.
* `StyleSheet`: define and manage styles efficiently.

---

## Platform-Specific APIs

* Some APIs are exclusive to Android or iOS.
* These are used when accessing features unique to a specific platform.

---

## Learning Approach

* The course focuses on essential components and APIs.
* Not every component is covered in detail.
* Once the fundamentals are understood, additional components can be learned independently.
