*** 1- Core Components and APIs ***
## Section Overview

This section introduces the core components and APIs in React Native that are most commonly used to build mobile applications.

---

## Purpose of Core Components and APIs

* React Native provides a set of built-in (core) components and APIs.
* These are sufficient for building most application user interfaces.
* While React Native includes many more components than covered here, the course focuses on those used most frequently.

---

## Where to Find the Full List

* Official documentation: reactnative.dev
* Navigate to the **API** section.
* The documentation includes:

  * Core UI components
  * Platform-specific components
  * Native APIs

---

## Core UI Components

* Core components are **cross-platform**.
* They work on both Android and iOS.
* During compilation, each component is mapped to its **native equivalent**.

### Example

* A `Button` component:

  * Appears as a standard Android button on Android.
  * Appears as a standard iOS button on iOS.

### Customization

* The appearance and behavior of components can be customized using **styles**.
* Styling will be covered in the next section.

---

## Platform-Specific Components

* React Native also provides components designed specifically for:

  * Android
  * iOS
* These are used when platform-specific behavior or UI is required.

---

## Core APIs

* APIs are not UI elements.
* They provide access to native functionality.
* Most core APIs are **cross-platform**.

### Examples

* `Keyboard`: control and interact with the soft keyboard.
* `StyleSheet`: define and manage styles efficiently.

---

## Platform-Specific APIs

* Some APIs are exclusive to Android or iOS.
* These are used when accessing features unique to a specific platform.

---

## Learning Approach

* The course focuses on essential components and APIs.
* Not every component is covered in detail.
* Once the fundamentals are understood, additional components can be learned independently.

*** 2- View ***

* Introduction to **Views**

## View Component

### Purpose of View

* `View` is the most basic and fundamental component in React Native.
* It replaces HTML elements like `div`, `span`, and `p`.
* It is a **container component** used for:

  * Grouping elements
  * Layout and structure

---

### View as a Container

* A `View` can contain other components (children).
* It is primarily used to control layout and positioning.

-------------------code----------------------
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
-------------------code----------------------

### Basic Styling Example

* `flex: 1`

  * Makes the view flexible.
  * Allows it to expand horizontally and vertically.
  * When applied to the root view, it fills the entire screen.

* `backgroundColor`

  * Can use named colors (e.g., `white`, `dodgerblue`).
  * Can also use RGB or other color formats, similar to web development.
-------------------code----------------------  
backgroundColor: 'dodgerblue'
-------------------code----------------------

### Layout and Alignment (Brief Overview)

* `alignItems` and `justifyContent`:

  * Used to align child components inside a view.
  * Commonly used to center content horizontally and vertically.
* These properties will be covered in detail in the layout section.

---

### Notch and Screen Edges Issue

* On modern devices (especially iPhones), screen notches can overlap content.
* Without proper handling, text or UI elements may appear behind the notch.

---

## SafeAreaView

### Purpose

* `SafeAreaView` is a special type of view.
* It ensures content stays within the safe visible area of the screen.
* Especially important for devices with notches or rounded corners.
-------------------code----------------------
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: 'dodgerblue',

  },
});
-------------------code----------------------
---

### How It Works

* Adds automatic padding (usually at the top).
* Prevents content from being hidden behind system UI elements.

---

### Usage

* Import `SafeAreaView` from React Native.
* Replace a regular `View` with `SafeAreaView` when necessary.

---

### Developer Tip: Multi-Cursor Editing

* Use multi-cursor editing to replace multiple instances at once:

  * Mac: Command + D
  * Windows: Control + D
* Useful for quickly refactoring components.

---

## Summary

* `View` is the foundation of layout in React Native.
* Styles control size, color, and alignment.
* `SafeAreaView` protects content from screen notches.
